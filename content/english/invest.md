  title: "No More Stock Market Dips"
  content: "With Soma's Investment Protection feature, your investments are protected against losses.<sup>2</sup> 
  If a borrower stops repaying you, we'll reimburse you up to 100% of the outstanding balance at default.<br><br>
  We believe people should **not** be forced to choose between stock market dips and low returns from bank CDs. The typical
  stock market return looks like a mountain-top: sharp inclines and declines in an upward direction. Soma's goal is to flatten
  the mountain-top and remove sharp declines."
