  summary: "We believe that the key to long-term financial success is to allow borrowers to build the loans that fit their own unique lifestyles. For this reason, all of our loans are customized by our borrowers and
  the annual percentage rates always fall between 6.5% and 10%. There are no misleading rates, and we continually monitor and look for ways to lower the rates as our environment changes.
  <br> <br> However, we also know that some borrowers require more time, attention, and resources than others. In order to operate our platform and dedicate the right amount of resources to the right borrowers, 
  we charge a platform fee based on the estimated amount of resources each individual who signs up will require. Each borrower's fee is different, and the fee is calculated from criteria such as credit score, estimated financial literacy, and length 
  of relationship with Soma. The estimated median fee is $83.90 and is as low as $12.13.<sup>5</sup> This one-time fee is charged only if and when your loan is funded. By paying the fee, you ensure that we can hire support staff, provide financial literacy resources, and operate our 
  platform into the future."

    label: "Visit Our Resource Center"
  q1: "What is a personal loan?"
  a1: "<br>A Soma loan is an unsecured personal loan. This type of loan is money borrowed from a lender (in our case from another person) that is paid back over a fixed period of time, such as 1 or 18 months. This type of loan is **not** backed by collateral like your home or car. Instead, the loans are issued based on creditworthiness.
      <br><br> Personal loans can be used for a variety of purposes. Some choose to use their loan for debt consolidation or to refinance high interest debt, while others use it to fund big purchases.<br><br>"
  q2: "Am I qualified for a Soma loan?"
  a2: "<br>Soma qualifies individuals for loans based on creditworthiness. In order for a borrower to be qualified to build a loan on our platform, a borrower must have a credit score of 600 or higher *or* have no prior history of credit (reflected in a 000 credit score).<br><br>"
  q3: "How long will it take to get my money?"
  a3: "<br>Once your loan is built on our platform, it then gets placed in front of investors. If you choose a higher interest rate when building your loan, there is a greater likelihood that your loan will get funded. 
      <br><br> If and when your loan is funded, you have 24 hours to review the details of your loan. You can waive this review period by logging onto your Soma app and selecting the 'waive review period' option. 
      If you have waived your review period or have waited the 24 hours, it then takes as little as 2 business days for the funds to transfer into your bank account.
      <br><br> In total, it can take as little as 2 business days for you to receive funds in your bank account after building your loan.<br><br>"
  q4: "How much can I borrow?"
  a4: "<br>You can borrow between $300 and $5,000. The exact amount you may borrow depends on what you qualify for based on your application information.<br><br>"
  q5: "Will I have to pay any fees?"
  a5: "<br>All of our loans are customized by our borrowers and the annual percentage rates always fall between 6.5% and 10%.
      <br><br> In order to operate our platform and dedicate the right amount of resources to the right borrowers, we charge a platform fee based on 
      the estimated amount of resources each individual who signs up will require. Each borrower’s fee is different, and the fee is calculated from 
      criteria such as credit score, estimated financial literacy, and length of relationship with Soma. The estimated median fee is $83.90 and is as low as $12.13.<sup>5</sup> 
      This one-time fee is charged only if and when your loan is funded. By paying the fee, you ensure that we can hire support staff, provide financial literacy resources, and operate our platform into the future.<br><br>"
  q6: "Will applying affect my credit score?"
  a6: "<br>Checking to see if you qualify for a loan on the Soma platform will not affect your credit score. If you proceed with your application after being qualified, your credit score may be impacted.
      <br><br>When you check your eligibility, we make a soft credit inquiry. Soft credit inquiries on your report do not lower your credit score, but you may see when you view your report that this 
      inquiry was made. If you are offered a loan and proceed with the application, we will then make a hard credit inquiry to verify the accuracy of your application. This action will be recorded as an inquiry on your report and it may impact your credit score.<br><br>"
  q7: "What are Soma Resources?"
  a7: "<br>Soma Resources are external resources that we have found useful to help navigate the financial world. We provide them in hopes that they can be useful to you. We are not responsible for any materials posted by, 
      nor do we receive any monetary benefit from, the external resources that we provide. Please use them at your discretion.<br><br>"
